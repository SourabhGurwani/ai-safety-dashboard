## Design Decisions and Challenges

- **Design Decisions**:
  - The project uses React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and scalability.
  - CSS Variables are used for theming to ensure a consistent and customizable design.
  - React Hooks are leveraged for state management to keep the codebase simple and functional.

- **Challenges**:
  - Ensuring responsiveness across all screen sizes required extensive testing and adjustments.
  - Managing complex filtering and sorting logic for incidents while maintaining performance.
